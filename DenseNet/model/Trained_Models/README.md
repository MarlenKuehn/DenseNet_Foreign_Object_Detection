# Information about the Trained Models

For detailed information about the training process and the results, please refer to the thesis. The parameters and results of the models are saved in the corresponding text files. The trained model with their weights are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18dPp1yi6RvYIGMRyjZoqxCColMbDsWM9 with the file names 'Training_A.pth', 'Training_B.pth' and 'Training_C.pth accordingly.

## Training A

This model was trained to detect only electrical devices like pacemakers, single chamber devices, dual chamber devices and dai's (ICD's) with a DenseNet201 architecture. 

## Training B

This model was trained to detect all foreign objects of the PadChest dataset with a DenseNet169 architecture.

## Training C

This model was trained to detect all foreign objects of the PadChest dataset with a DenseNet201 architecture.
